Pftpd is an implementation of a multithreaded anonymous FTP server.

FEATURES

* Uses multithreading on systems with usable threads systems in
  order to minimize the system impact and improve response time.

* Uses sendfile() on systems that support it to increase performance
  and decrease system impact.

* Has a built in "ls".

* Supports user-specific anonymous directories (a subdir of the
  user's normal home directory.

* Can optionally "contain" the available environment using
  chroot'ed (but then the user-specific anonymous directories
  won't work for obvious reasons). This is *not* the default,
  but see below.

* Supports active and passive transfers

* Supports restartable transfers (both Binary/Image and ASCII).

* By default only supports READ access to the files (all the
  commands that can create or modify files are disabled). Using an
  option you can enable READ/WRITE mode - but see below.



DOWNLOAD:

The main FTP site for it is:

	ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/unix/pftpd/


IMPORTANT FILES AND DIRECTORIES

The default paths to important files and directories are:

Base prefix is /usr/local 	(--prefix=/usr/local)

$PREFIX /etc   /pftpd.conf 	(--sysconfdir=$PREFIX/etc)

The rest have defaults that depend on the configure options, but can
also be modified using the configuration file and/or command line options.

$PREFIX /var   /run/pftpd.pid 	(--localstatedir=$PREFIX/var)
$PREFIX /var   /rpad		(--localstatedir=$PREFIX/var)
$PREFIX /share /ftp		(--datadir=$PREFIX/share)

The last path is normally not used - it defaults to the HOME
directory of any "ftp" user if such a users is defined.



INSTALLATION:

Configure and compile it with:

	./configure ; make

Copy the binary "src/pftpd" and optionally "src/rpad" to a system
directory of your choice and then select how you want to start them
(rpad first). Pftpd supports three different modes of startup:

	1. Standalone daemon. Just run the binary and it will fork
		and put itself into the background
	2. Start it from /etc/inetd.conf
	3. Start it from /etc/inittab (for systems with a SysV init).

Pftpd has a number of command line options, try:

	src/pftpd --help

for a listing of them all. By default Pftpd will run in read-only
mode, and only allow FTP commands that retreive files or listings.


WHAT'S THIS 'RPAD' THING?

RPAD stands for "Restricted Port Allocation Daemon" and is used
by Pftpd to be able to create sockets bound to the FTP-DATA port
(which is in the restricted area) even though it doesn't run as root.


USER SPECIFIC PUBLIC DIRECTORIES

By enabling the option for user directories the FTP server will
try to access the specified directory when a client tries to access
something via a path like:

	/~USER/something

Since the FTP server runs as user ftp or nobody (by default), for this
to work the users' home directory and the specificed public directory
must be accessible by user nobody and/or ftp.

It is sufficient with "x" rights for "others" for the home directory,
but you probably want both "x" and "r" rights for the public directory.



CHROOTED ENVIRONMENT

Pftpd by default will *not* chroot to the "anonymous" public area.
Instead it tries to make sure that any filename or path's specified
by an FTP client can't reach any files outside the designated area.

This means that symbolic files pointing outside the area *will* work.

This also means that it allows user-specific anonymous directories in
the users' home directories.



READ/WRITE MODE

By default the FTP server only allows the commands that doesn't
(potentially - access rights also apply of course) modify old or
create new files.

You can enable READ/WRITE mode, but then you should be aware that
all files created will be owned by user that pftpd runs as
(normally "ftp" or "nobody") or files that the FTP server
tries to modify must be set up so that the user pftpd runs
as have enough access rights.



BUG REPORTS

Please send bug reports to pen@lysator.liu.se - however note that,
even though I might not respond immediately, I will read your email
eventually.

If there is a *REALLY* urgent security-related issue with PFTPD that
needs *IMMEDIATELY* attention, please call the Linköping University
phone exchange and request to be connected to my work office extension
at the Physics Department (IFM).
