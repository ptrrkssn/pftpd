Some known issues with Pftpd
----------------------------

Inless Pftps is built with support for the RPAD service then Pftpd
*never* will use the FTP-DATA (20) port for passive file transfers.

This could potentially cause some trouble with firewalls requiring
that data sessions originate *from* an address with source port 20
(when using non-PASV connections). I've never seen this myself though...

The reason it doesn't do that is that it drops all root privileges
as early as possible, so it can't create new sockets and bind them
to ports in the reserved range (<1024).

With the RPAD services (the rpad daemon is included in the
distribution (but only builds on certains systems - Solaris 2.7
or newer (ie, systems with a working DOORS IPC mechanism)) it
will contact the 'rpad' daemon (which runs as root) and will
allocate, and bind (to port 20) a socket which will then be
passed to Pftpd via the DOORS IPC mechanism).
